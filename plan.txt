Bus Ticket System: Forms & Pages Submission Plan
================================================

1. Current Status (as of 2025-06-13)
-------------------------------------
- All major forms (Search, Payment, Support Contact, Seat Selection) use React controlled components and have validation.
- Submissions are handled in React (no full page reloads), using mutation hooks or fetch.
- User receives feedback via toast notifications for both success and error states.
- No missing submit handlers or broken forms detected in main pages/components.

2. Issues or Gaps
-----------------
- No explicit server-side validation checks reviewed (assumed to be handled in API).
- Payment/booking flows depend on correct API endpoints and backend logic.
- No end-to-end (e2e) or integration tests for form flows.
- No explicit accessibility (a11y) checks or ARIA attributes reviewed.

3. Recommended Next Steps
-------------------------
A. Testing & Validation
   - Add e2e tests for all major form flows (search, booking, payment, support contact) using Cypress or Playwright.
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints (especially /api/support, /api/bookings, /api/payments).
   - Review and enhance server-side validation for all form submissions.

B. User Experience (UX)
   - Review and improve error messages for clarity and helpfulness.
   - Ensure loading states are visible during async submissions.
   - Add accessibility (a11y) improvements: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support.

C. Code & Architecture
   - Refactor repeated form logic into reusable hooks/components if not already done.
   - Document form flows and API contract in README or developer docs.
   
D. Deployment & Monitoring
   - Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry) for form submission failures.
   - Ensure production/staging environments have all required API endpoints.

4. Optional Improvements
------------------------
- Add user-facing confirmation emails for bookings/support requests.
- Add form autosave/draft functionality for long forms (optional).
- Collect analytics on form drop-off/completion rates.
